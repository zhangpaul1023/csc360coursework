## Assignment #3 evaluation

* Name: `Zhang, Paul`
* VNum: `V00929523`
* Netlink: `zhangpaul1023`

The evaluation below refers in places to specific test numbers.
Some details of these tests can be found in `TESTING.md` located on
`linux.csc.uvic.ca` in `/home/zastre/csc360/assign3/eval-info/`. Also
in that directory are some possible bash scripts used to run the
simulator (but not for task 2 activities).

### Preliminaries

* `rrsim.c` submitted; PDF with graphs submitted: **All code files correctly submitted**
* Able to built executable of `rrsim`:  **Able to make submission**
* `README.md` provided: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**

### Implementation of round-robin scheduling simulator
* Test with a single event: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**
* Test with two widely separated events: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**
* Test using events provided in assignment description: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**
* Test with 10 events: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**
* Test with 100 events: **Output is not what is expected. It looks like you submitted code you modified to allow for the creation of your graphs (as noted in your readme)? I attempted to remove the commented out lines to see if this fixed the problem - it paritally did but the output order was not correct.**

### Simulation runs and graph visualizations
* Graph showing trends of waiting times: **PNG files found - needed PDFs. Graph has properly labeled axes and plots; appears to show average waiting times for different quantum lengths.**
* Graph showing trends of turnaround times: **PNG files found - need PDFs. Graph has properly labeled axes and plots; appears to show average waiting timGraph has properly labeled axes and plots; appears to show average turnaround times for different quantum lengths.**
* Any scripts providing that automated data-wrangling tasks? **No script found.**

---
### Other
* Observations after reading submitted code: **No comments and lots of global variables.**

### Any other general comments
I tried to remove your commented out print statements but did not have luck  undoing your changes to see simulator output.

### Grade for submitted work (either letter or out of 100)
* **30**
